## ⚠️ THINKING PROTOCOL — MANDATORY

> **THE IRON LAW:** Before processing ANY task, you MUST:
> 1. **READ** this master skill file completely
> 2. **ACTIVATE** the Predictive Context Engine
> 3. **ROUTE** through Adaptive Routing Engine  
> 4. **VERIFY** Decision Audit Trail is logging
> 5. **ONLY THEN** begin execution

> ❌ NEVER start work without completing this protocol
> ❌ NEVER skip steps regardless of task simplicity
> ❌ NEVER ignore Token Economy constraints

## 🧠 Cognitive Flow Architecture

Kilo-Kit treats interactions as **continuous flows**, not discrete events:

```
Traditional:  Task → Process → Response (done)

Kilo-Kit:     ┌─────────────────────────────┐
              │      COGNITIVE FLOW         │
              │                             │
    Input ───►│  Predict → Execute → Learn  │───► Output
              │      ↑              │       │
    Next  ───►│      └──────────────┘       │───► Better
              │                             │
              └─────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🔄 Processing Pipeline

### Stage 1: INTAKE (Predictive Context Engine)

```yaml
activation_trigger: Any new user input

actions:
  1. Parse user intent:
     - Extract explicit keywords
     - Infer implicit needs
     - Detect emotional tone
     - Identify urgency level
  
  2. Predict required context:
     - Which skills likely needed (top 3)
     - What files likely relevant
     - What history is pertinent
     - What tools might be called
  
  3. Prefetch context:
     - Load predicted skills (metadata + body)
     - Cache relevant file contents
     - Prepare tool configurations
     - Estimate token budget

output:
  - intent_analysis: { type, confidence, keywords[], urgency }
  - predicted_context: { skills[], files[], tools[] }
  - token_estimate: { min, max, recommended_mode }
```

### Stage 2: ROUTE (Adaptive Routing Engine)

```yaml
activation_trigger: After INTAKE completes

actions:
  1. Match skills to intent:
     - Score each skill by relevance (0.0-1.0)
     - Consider historical success rates
     - Factor in user preferences
     - Apply context modifiers
  
  2. Compose behavior chain:
     - Select primary skill
     - Identify supporting behaviors
     - Build execution DAG
     - Optimize for parallelism
  
  3. Log decision trail:
     - Record all considered options
     - Document scoring rationale
     - Save alternative paths
     - Timestamp everything

output:
  - selected_skill: { id, confidence, reason }
  - behavior_chain: [ {behavior, config, dependencies}... ]
  - decision_audit: { id, timestamp, reasoning, alternatives }
```

### Stage 3: EXECUTE (Execution Engine)

```yaml
activation_trigger: After ROUTE completes

actions:
  1. Validate budget (Token Economy):
     - Check against estimated usage
     - Select appropriate quality mode
     - Reserve tokens for verification
     - Track actual usage
  
  2. Execute behavior chain:
     - Run behaviors in DAG order
     - Parallelize independent branches
     - Collect intermediate results
     - Handle errors gracefully
  
  3. Apply quality gates:
     - Validate outputs at each step
     - Ensure type safety
     - Check for regressions
     - Verify against requirements

output:
  - execution_result: { success, outputs[], token_used }
  - quality_report: { gates_passed[], gates_failed[] }
  - error_context: { if_any }
```

### Stage 4: LEARN (Feedback Loop)

```yaml
activation_trigger: After EXECUTE completes

actions:
  1. Update skill analytics:
     - Record success/failure
     - Track token efficiency
     - Measure user satisfaction
     - Calculate context fit score
  
  2. Persist knowledge:
     - Save successful patterns
     - Update knowledge graph
     - Adjust routing weights
     - Flag skills for review
  
  3. Prepare for next flow:
     - Cache likely next contexts
     - Update user model
     - Refine predictions
     - Clean up resources

output:
  - skill_metrics_update: { skill_id, delta }
  - knowledge_graph_update: { nodes[], edges[] }
  - prediction_adjustments: { weights[] }
```

## 📋 Skill Dispatch Table (Adaptive)

| Intent Keywords | Primary Skill | Confidence Boost |
|-----------------|---------------|------------------|
| `bug, error, fix, debug, broken` | `skills/debugging/systematic/` | +0.15 if recent test failure |
| `validate, validation, check` | `skills/debugging/defense-in-depth/` | +0.10 if security context |
| `root cause, why, understand` | `skills/debugging/root-cause/` | +0.20 if 3rd+ fix attempt |
| `verify, confirm, done` | `skills/debugging/verification/` | +0.25 if completion claimed |
| `review, PR, code review` | `skills/quality/code-review/` | +0.15 if git context |
| `test, TDD, testing` | `skills/quality/testing/` | +0.10 if new feature |
| `security, auth, OWASP` | `skills/development/security/` | +0.30 if auth-related |
| `API, backend, server` | `skills/development/backend/` | +0.05 if TypeScript/Python |

**Adaptive Adjustments:**
- Skills with >80% success rate get +0.10 boost

## 💰 Token Economy Modes

| Mode | Token Multiplier | Use When |
|------|------------------|----------|
| **🟢 Economy** | 0.6x baseline | Simple, well-defined tasks |
| **🟡 Standard** | 1.0x baseline | Most tasks (default) |
| **🟠 Premium** | 1.5x baseline | Complex, multi-step tasks |
| **🔴 Critical** | 2.0x baseline | Production issues, security |

**Auto-Selection Rules:**
```
IF urgency == "high" AND type == "security": mode = Critical
ELSE IF complexity > 7 OR files_touched > 5: mode = Premium
ELSE IF intent_confidence < 0.6: mode = Standard (need exploration)
ELSE IF task_familiarity > 0.9: mode = Economy
ELSE: mode = Standard
```

  - [ ] Run relevant tests if applicable
  - [ ] Check for obvious regressions
  - [ ] Ensure user request addressed
  - [ ] Document what was done

if_gate_fails:

  - Adjust for next attempt
```

## 🔧 Composable Behavior Units

### Atomic Behaviors (Cannot decompose)

| Behavior | Purpose | Token Cost |
|----------|---------|------------|
| `parse_input` | Parse and structure input | ~50 |
| `search_code` | Search codebase | ~100 |
| `read_file` | Read file content | ~20 |
| `write_file` | Write file content | ~30 |
| `run_cmd` | Execute command | ~40 |
| `validate` | Validate data/code | ~60 |
| `reason` | Logical reasoning | ~200 |
| `generate` | Generate content | ~300 |

### Compound Behaviors (Composable)

```yaml
trace_error:
  components: [parse_input, search_code, reason]
  purpose: Trace error to source

modify_safely:
  components: [read_file, validate, write_file, validate]
  purpose: Safe file modification

test_change:
  components: [write_file, run_cmd, parse_input]
  purpose: Write and test change
```

### Composition Rules

```
SEQUENTIAL: A → B → C (output flows to next)
PARALLEL:   A | B | C (run independently)  
CONDITIONAL: IF(A) THEN B ELSE C
LOOP:       WHILE(condition) DO A
FALLBACK:   TRY A CATCH B
```

## 🚀 Quick Reference Commands

### Starting a Task
```
1. Parse intent from user input
2. Check token budget
3. Route to appropriate skill
4. Log decision trail
5. Execute behavior chain
6. Apply quality gates
7. Learn from outcome
```

### When Stuck
```
1. Check: Is intent clear? (If not → ask clarifying question)
2. Check: Is skill matched? (If not → try related keywords)
3. Check: Is budget sufficient? (If not → switch to Economy mode)
4. Check: Did behavior fail? (If yes → check error, try fallback)
5. Check: Are gates failing? (If yes → identify which, address root cause)
```

### Before Claiming Done
```
1. Verify: Changes exist (read/run to confirm)
2. Verify: Tests pass (if applicable)
3. Verify: No regressions
4. Verify: User request fully addressed
5. Document: What was done and why
```
